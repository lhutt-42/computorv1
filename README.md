# computorv1

computorv1 is a command-line interface (CLI) application written in Rust that solves polynomial equations up to the second degree.


## Features

* Solves linear equations (first degree, `ax + b = 0`).

* Solves quadratic equations (second degree, `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`).

* Handles both real and complex roots.


## Usage

To use computorv1, run the compiled binary and input your equation:

```bash
./computor "2 * X^2 + 4 * X - 6 = 0"
```

The solver will then output the roots of the equation.
